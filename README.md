SOM - Simple Object Machine
===========================

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was also used for teaching.

Currently, implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), and
Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple SOM Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains a plain Java implementation of SOM, including an implementation of the SOM standard library. Please see the [main project page][SOMst] for links to the VM implementation.

Make sure to initialize the shared Smalltalk standard library, tests, and examples by importing the git submodule:

    $ git submodule update --init

To build and run SOM, Java 8 or newer is required.

SOM can be built with Ant:

    $ ant jar

Afterwards, the tests can be executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som

or with:

    $ ant test
 
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello/Hello.som
